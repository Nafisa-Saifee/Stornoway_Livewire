                                <p>Stornoway started as a statement against the sloppy professional standards that dominated the field of construction services 20 years ago. We wanted to set a new, high standard and work as consultants, solving our clientsâ€™ problems. </p>
                                <p className="hisp">The company quickly grew and cemented itself as the new golden standard in commercial construction. Today we continue to build on that legacy and strive for excellence at everything we do.</p>
